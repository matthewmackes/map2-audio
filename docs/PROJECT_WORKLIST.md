## Active Blockers Only

Archive: Completed and otherwise non-blocked work has been moved to `docs/archive/PROJECT_WORKLIST_ARCHIVE_20260316.md`.

## AVB

ID: T004
Status: [✗] Blocked
Title: AVB hardware qualification and release gating
Description:
- Goal / acceptance criteria: Complete the remaining AVB hardware-in-the-loop qualification gates formerly tracked under `T004`, including discovery/churn, active-stream validation, PTP timing, and soak evidence.

- Dependencies: AVB-capable lab availability, active AVB entities/streams, stable PTP grandmaster lock
- Estimated effort: High
- Required outputs: Updated qualification matrix, archived evidence artifacts, and pass/fail summary for the AVB gates.
Subtasks: None
Assigned to: Lab + Codex

## JUCE Grid UI Polish

ID: T193
Status: [✓] Done
Title: JUCE Grid — Automation panel background matches page surface (seamless integration)
Description:

- Dependencies: None
- Estimated effort: Low–Medium
- Required outputs: See completion notes.
Subtasks: None
Assigned to: Claude
Last updated: 2026-03-16 - Claude
- Completion notes:
  - `.juce-grid-page__automation-panel` background changed from `var(--cds-layer)` to `var(--cds-background, #161616)` — matches outermost page surface.
  - `JuceGridRoutingVisualizer.tsx` fully redesigned: all hardcoded rgba/hex constants replaced with Carbon token constants (`C_BACKGROUND`, `C_LAYER`, `C_BORDER`, `C_LINK`, `C_PURPLE`, etc.). Flow nodes now sharp-edged (rx=0) with left-border stripe using `--flow-color`. Terminal nodes (Input/Output) replaced with typographic bookends (label + flanking `<line>` rules, no box). Morph block now uses `C_PURPLE` throughout with sharp edges and animated progress bar. Wire rendering split into base layer (low opacity) + animated gradient sweep layer (`juce-grid-routing-sweep` keyframe) on active paths only. `ArrowRight` from `@carbon/icons-react` imported and `WireArrow` helper exported for inline icon use.
  - `JuceGridPage.css` routing diagram section: `.juce-grid-page__routing-diagram` gets `background: var(--cds-background)` and increased padding/gap for airy spacing. Wire sweep `@keyframes` added. All `rgba(255,255,255,*)` label fallbacks replaced with named Carbon token fallbacks (`#c6c6c6`, `#f4f4f4`). Morph value uses `var(--cds-purple-30, #d4bbff)`. `.juce-grid-page__routing-morph-progress` gets `transition: width 240ms ease`.
  - Layout constants increased: node width 132px (was 116), height 62px (was 56), horizontal gap 56px (was 32), row gap 92px (was 78).
  - Validation: `npm run typecheck` → pass, `npm run build` → pass (19.47s, zero errors).
